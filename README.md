# Cálculo de Vale Alimentação

## Project Overview
Cálculo de Vale Alimentação is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their meal allowance considering holidays and work schedules. The application provides an intuitive interface where users can select their starting month, specify their daily allowance rate, and account for extra working days. It utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling and Font Awesome for icons, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
